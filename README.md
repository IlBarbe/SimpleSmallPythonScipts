Hi, I’m @IlBarbe, I’m a biologist who fancies informatics and bioinformatics. I mostly use Phython and R (and bash of course) in my research. 
I also like to automate and make my life and research easier using arduino, ESP32 and other microcontrollers with C++ and micropython.

If you ever end up reading this and you need more details and information you can reach me here: barbe.dosh@gmail.com
